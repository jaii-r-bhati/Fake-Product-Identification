Key Features:
Unique product identification using QR/NFC.
Blockchain ledger (e.g., Ethereum or Hyperledger) to record each transaction.
Smart contracts to automate verification.
Role-based access for stakeholders.
Mobile/web-based interface for product verification by end-users.

The system ensures:
Transparency: All stakeholders can access real-time product information.
Traceability: Every transaction is traceable back to the point of origin.
Security: Immutable records prevent unauthorized tampering.
Scalability: The architecture is designed to accommodate large-scale commercial implementation.

Technologies Used:
Blockchain Framework: Ethereum / Hyperledger Fabric
Frontend: React.js / Angular (optional)
Backend: Node.js / Python (Flask/Django)
Database (for off-chain data): MongoDB / PostgreSQL
Smart Contract Language: Solidity
Integration Tools: Web3.js / Ethers.js
QR/NFC Tagging: For physical linkage with the digital ledger

Objectives:
To develop a tamper-proof product tracking system.
To minimize counterfeit products in the supply chain.
To build consumer trust by providing transparency.
To explore the use of smart contracts for automated product validation.
